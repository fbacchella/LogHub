6,tcpControlBits,unsigned16,flags,current,"TCP control bits observed for the packets of this Flow. This information is encoded as a bit field; each TCP control bit has a corresponding bit in that field. A bit is set to 1 if any observed packet of this Flow has the corresponding TCP control bit set to 1. The bit is cleared to 0 otherwise. Per [RFC9293], the assignment of TCP control bits is managed by IANA via the ""TCP Header Flags"" registry [https://www.iana.org/assignments/tcp-parameters/tcp-parameters.xhtml#tcp-header-flags]. Implementers can retrieve the current TCP control bits from that
  registry, which is authoritative for them. As the most significant 4 bits of octets 12 and 13 (counting from zero) of the TCP header [RFC9293] are used to encode the TCP data offset (header length), the corresponding bits in this Information Element MUST be reported by the Exporter with a value of zero and MUST be ignored by the Collector. Use the tcpHeaderLength Information Element to encode this value. All TCP control bits (including those unassigned) MUST be exported as observed in the TCP headers of the packets of this Flow. If exported as a single octet with reduced-size encoding (Section 6.2 of [RFC7011]), this Information Element covers the low-order octet of this field (i.e., bit offset positions 8 to 15) [https://www.iana.org/assignments/tcp-parameters/tcp-parameters.xhtml#tcp-header-flags]. A Collector receiving this Information Element with reduced-size encoding must not assume anything about the content of the four bits with bit offset positions 4 to 7. Exporting Processes exporting this Information Element on behalf of a Metering Process that is not capable of observing any of the flags with bit offset positions 4 to 7 SHOULD use reduced-size encoding, and only export the least significant 8 bits of this Information Element. Note that previous revisions of this Information Element's definition specified that flags with bit offset positions 8 and 9 must be exported as zero, even if observed. Collectors should therefore not assume that a value of zero for these bits in this Information Element indicates the bits were never set in the observed traffic, especially if these bits are zero in every Flow Record sent by a given Exporter. Note also that the ""TCP Header Flags"" registry
  [https://www.iana.org/assignments/tcp-parameters/tcp-parameters.xhtml#tcp-header-flags] indexes the bit offset from the most significant bit of octet 12 to the least significant bit of octet 13 in the TCP header, but the tcpControlBits is encoded as a regular unsigned 16-bit integer.",,,"See the assigned TCP control bits in the ""TCP Header Flags"" registry

+--------+----------+-----------------------------------------------+ The Stability Class portion of this flags word describes the
stability class of the anonymization technique applied to a
referenced Information Element within a referenced Template.
Stability classes refer to the stability of the parameters of the
anonymization technique, and therefore the comparability of the
mapping between the real and anonymized values over time.  This
determines which anonymized datasets may be compared with each
other.  Values are as follows: +-----+-----+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Bit | Bit | Description                                           |

|     |     | remain comparable; while the Collecting Process MAY   |
|     |     | assume Session level stability, Session level         |
|     |     | stability is not guaranteed.  Processes SHOULD assume |
|     |     | this is the case in the absence of stability class    |
|     |     | information; this is the default stability class.     |

                          encode common IPv6 extension headers when observed in a Flow. The ""No Next Header"" (bit 2) value (Section 4.7 of [RFC8200]) is used if
                          there is no upper-layer header in an IPv6 packet. Even if the value is not considered as an

This IE is a subTemplateList of ipv6ExtensionHeaderType and ipv6ExtensionHeaderCount IEs. Each header chain in Flow with varying extension header chain MUST be exported in a separate IE. The same extension header type may appear several times in an ipv6ExtensionHeaderTypeCountList IE.
                          For example, if an IPv6 packet of a Flow includes a Hop-by-Hop Options header, a Destination Options
                          header, a Fragment header, and Destination Options header, the ipv6ExtensionHeaderTypeCountList IE
                          will report: * the count of Hop-by-Hop Options headers, * the occurrences of the Destination Options headers that are observed before a Fragment header, * the occurrences of the Fragment headers, and * the occurrences of the Destination Options headers that are observed right after a Fragment header.

                          extension headers are often dropped in the Internet (e.g., [RFC7872]). As discussed in Section 1.2 of [RFC8883], some hardware devices implement
                          a parsing buffer of a fixed size to process packets, including all the headers. When the aggregate
